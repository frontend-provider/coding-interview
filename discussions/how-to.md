To start a new discussion, make a new file, and if necessary, a directory:

examples:

- interviews/google-interviews.md
- interviews/amazon-interviews.md

**Please do not discuss interview questions.**
That's not fair to the employees who invest many hours into 
preparing, creating, improving, and calibrating their questions 
in order to make good hiring decisions. (even if you didn't sign an NDA)
Discussing topics covered (BSTs, heaps, etc) is ok.
