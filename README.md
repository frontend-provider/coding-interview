# Google Interview University

_If you like this project, please give me a star._ &#9733;

## What is it?

This is my multi-month study plan for going from web developer (self-taught, no CS degree) to Google software engineer.

![Coding at the whiteboard - from HBO's Silicon Valley](https://dng5l3qzreal6.cloudfront.net/2016/Aug/coding_board_small-1470866369118.jpg)

This long list has been extracted and expanded from Google's coaching notes, so these are the things you need to know. 
There are extra items I added at the bottom that may come up in the interview or be helpful in solving a problem.

Many items are from Steve Yegge's "[Get that job at Google](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html)"
and are reflected sometimes word-for-word in Google's coaching notes.

## Why use it?

I'm following this plan to prepare for my Google interview. I've been building the web, building
services, and launching startups since 1997. I have an economics degree, not a CS degree.  I've
been very successful in my career, but I want to work at Google. I want to progress into larger systems
and get a real understanding of computer systems, algorithmic efficiency, data structure performance,
low-level languages, and how it all works. And if you don't know any of it, Google won't hire you.

When I started this project, I didn't know a stack from a heap, didn't know Big-O anything, anything about trees, or how to
traverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it wouldn't have been very good.
Every data structure I've ever used was built into the language, and I didn't know how they worked
under the hood at all. I've never had to manage memory, unless a process I was running would give an "out of
memory" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I've used a few multi-dimensional arrays in my life and
thousands of associative arrays, but I've never created data structures from scratch.

But after going through this study plan I have high confidence I'll be hired. It's a long plan. It's going to take me
months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.

## How to use it

Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.

I'm using Github's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to check my progress.

I check each task box at the beginning of a line when I'm done with it. When all sub-items in a block are done,
I put [x] at the top level, meaning the entire block is done. Sorry you have to remove all my [x] markings
to use this the same way. If you search/replace, just replace [x] with [ ].
Sometimes I just put a [x] at top level if I know I've done all the subtasks, to cut down on clutter.

More about Github flavored markdown: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown

    I have a friendly referral already to get my resume in at Google. Thanks JP.

## Get in a Googley Mood

## About Video Resources

Some videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class. It is free to do so, but sometimes the classes
are no longer in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access. I'm going to be adding more videos
from public sources and replacing the online course videos over time. I like using university lectures.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

This short section were prerequisites/interesting info I wanted to learn before getting started on the daily plan.

You can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview, but for Google, these are solid choices:

- C++
- Java
- Python

You need to be very comfortable in the language, and be knowledgeable. Read more (rescued from the lost web):

## The Daily Plan:

Each subject does not require a whole day to be able to understand it fully, and you can do multiple of these in a day.

Each day I take one subject from the list below, watch videos about that subject, and write an implementation in:
    C - using structs and functions that take a struct * and something else as args.
    C++ - without using built-in types
    C++ - using built-in types, like STL's std::list for a linked list
    Python - using built-in types (to keep practicing Python)
    and write tests to ensure I'm doing it right, sometimes just using simple assert() statements
    You may do Java or something else, this is just my thing.

Why code in all of these?
    Practice, practice, practice, until I'm sick of it, and can do it with no problem (some have many edge cases and bookkeeping details to remember)
    Work within the raw constraints (allocating/freeing memory without help of garbage collection (except Python))
    Make use of built-in types so I have experience using the built-in tools for real-world use (not going to write my own linked list implementation in production)

I may not have time to do all of these for every subject, but I'll try.

You can see my code here:
 - C: https://github.com/jwasham/practice-c
 - C++: https://github.com/jwasham/practice-cpp
 - Python: https://github.com/jwasham/practice-python

You don't need to memorize the guts of every algorithm.

Write code on a whiteboard, not a computer. Test with some sample inputs.
Then test it out on a computer to make sure it's not buggy from syntax.

## Data Structures

- [x] **Arrays: (Implement an automatically resizing vector)**
    - [x] Description:
        - Arrays: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/OsBSF/arrays
        - Arrays: https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Basic-arrays/149042/177104-4.html
        - Multi-dim: https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Multidimensional-arrays/149042/177105-4.html
        - Dynamic Arrays: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/EwbnV/dynamic-arrays
        - Jagged: https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Jagged-arrays/149042/177106-4.html
        - Resizing arrays:
            - https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Resizable-arrays/149042/177108-4.html
    - [x] Implement a vector (mutable array with automatic resizing):
        - [x] Practice coding using arrays and pointers, and pointer math to jump to an index instead of using indexing.
        - [x] new raw data array with allocated memory
            - can allocate int array under the hood, just not use its features
            - start with 16, or if starting number is greater, use power of 2 - 16, 32, 64, 128
        - [x] size() - number of items
        - [x] capacity() - number of items it can hold
        - [x] is_empty()
        - [x] at(index) - returns item at given index, blows up if index out of bounds
        - [x] push(item)
        - [x] insert(index, item) - inserts item at index, shifts that index's value and trailing elements to the right
        - [x] prepend(item) - can use insert above at index 0
        - [x] pop() - remove from end, return value
        - [x] delete(index) - delete item at index, shifting all trailing elements left
        - [x] remove(item) - looks for value and removes index holding it (even if in multiple places)
        - [x] find(item) - looks for value and returns first index with that value, -1 if not found
        - [x] resize(new_capacity) // private function
            - when you reach capacity, resize to double the size
            - when popping an item, if size is 1/4 of capacity, resize to half
    - [x] Time
        - O(1) to add/remove at end (amortized for allocations for more space), index, or update
        - O(n) to insert/remove elsewhere
    - [x] Space
        - contiguous in memory, so proximity helps performance
        - space needed = (array capacity, which is >= n) * size of item, but even if 2n, still O(n)

- [x] **Linked Lists**
    - [x] Description:
        - [x] https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/kHhgK/singly-linked-lists
        - [x] CS 61B - Linked lists: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJtJOtXCW_M&list=PL-XXv-cvA_iAlnI-BQr9hjqADPBtujFJd&index=5
    - [x] C Code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN6FPiD0Gzo
            - not the whole video, just portions about Node struct and memory allocation.
    - [x] Linked List vs Arrays:
        - https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance/lecture/rjBs9/core-linked-lists-vs-arrays
        - https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance/lecture/QUaUd/in-the-real-world-lists-vs-arrays
    - [x] why you should avoid linked lists:
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo
    - [x] Gotcha: you need pointer to pointer knowledge:
        (for when you pass a pointer to a function that may change the address where that pointer points)
        This page is just to get a grasp on ptr to ptr. I don't recommend this list traversal style. Readability and maintainability suffer due to cleverness.
        - https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/int/sx8.html
    - [x] implement (I did with tail pointer & without):
        - [x] size() - returns number of data elements in list
        - [x] empty() - bool returns true if empty
        - [x] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
        - [x] push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
        - [x] pop_front() - remove front item and return its value
        - [x] push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
        - [x] pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
        - [x] front() - get value of front item
        - [x] back() - get value of end item
        - [x] insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so current item at that index is pointed to by new item at index
        - [x] erase(index) - removes node at given index
        - [x] value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at nth position from the end of the list
        - [x] reverse() - reverses the list
        - [x] remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value
    - [x] Doubly-linked List
        - Description: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/jpGKD/doubly-linked-lists
        - No need to implement

- [x] **Stack**
    - [x] https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/UdKzQ/stacks
    - [x] https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Using-stacks-last-first-out/149042/177120-4.html
    - [x] Will not implement. Implementing with array is trivial.

- [x] **Queue**
    - [x] https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Using-queues-first-first-out/149042/177122-4.html
    - [x] https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/EShpq/queue
    - [x] Circular buffer/FIFO: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer
    - [x] https://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Priority-queues-deques/149042/177123-4.html
    - [x] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
        - enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
        - empty()
    - [x] Implement using fixed-sized array:
        - enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
        - empty()
        - full()
    - [x] Cost:
        - a bad implementation using linked list where you enqueue at head and dequeue at tail would be O(n)
            because you'd need the next to last element, causing a full traversal each dequeue
        - enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing])
        - dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array)
        - empty: O(1) (linked list and array)

- [x] **Tries**

- [x] **Balanced search trees**
    - Know least one type of balanced binary tree (and know how it's implemented):
    - "Among balanced search trees, AVL and 2/3 trees are now passé, and red-black trees seem to be more popular.
        A particularly interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses rotations
        to move any accessed key to the root." - Skiena
    - Of these, I chose to implement a splay tree. From what I've read, you won't implement a
        balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up
        and let's face it, splay trees are the bee's knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code.
        - splay tree: insert, search, delete functions
        If you end up implementing red/black tree try just these:
        - search and insertion functions, skipping delete
    - I want to learn more about B-Tree since it's used so widely with very large data sets.
    - [x] Self-balancing binary search tree: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree

    - [x] **AVL trees**
        - In practice:
            From what I can tell, these aren't used much in practice, but I could see where they would be:
            The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly
            balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it
            attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language
            dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter).

    - [x] **Splay trees**
        - In practice:
            Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors,
            data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory,
            networking, and file system code) etc.

                - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnPl_Y6EqMo

    - [x] **2-3 search trees**
        - In practice:
            2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches (since height is more compared to AVL trees).
        You would use 2-3 tree very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red Black trees.

    - [x] **2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)**
        - In practice:
            For every 2-4 tree, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion
            operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an
            important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce
            2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though **2-4 trees are not often used in practice**.

    - [x] **B-Trees**
        - fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor)
        - In Practice:
            B-Trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to
            its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary
            block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block i address into a disk block
            (or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address.

    - [x] **Red/black trees**
        - In practice:
            Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time.
            Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications,
            but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees;
            for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and
            the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java,
            the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor
            hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used.

## Graphs

Graphs can be used to represent many problems in computer science, so this section is long, like trees and sorting were.

- Notes from Yegge:
    - There are three basic ways to represent a graph in memory:
        - objects and pointers
        - matrix
        - adjacency list
    - Familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons
    - BFS and DFS - know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code
    - When asked a question, look for a graph-based solution first, then move on if none.

- [x] **Dynamic Programming**
    - This subject can be pretty difficult, as each DP soluble problem must be defined as a recursion relation, and coming up with it can be tricky.
    - I suggest looking at many examples of DP problems until you have a solid understanding of the pattern involved.

            - Handling obscenely large amounts of data
        - system design
            - features sets
            - interfaces
            - class hierarchies
            - designing a system under certain constraints

## Final Review 

    This section will have shorter videos that can you watch pretty quickly to review most of the important concepts.
    It's nice if you want a refresher often.
    (More items will be added here)

#### General:

- [ ] Series of 2-3 minutes short subject videos (23 videos)
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4r1DZcx1cM&list=PLmVb1OknmNJuC5POdcDv5oCS7_OUkDgpj&index=22

#### Sorts:

- [ ] Merge Sort: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCae1WNvnZM
   

## Books

#### Mentioned in Google Coaching:

**Read and do exercises:**

- [ ] The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena)
    - Book (can rent on kindle):
        - http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202
    - Half.com is a great resource for textbooks at good prices.
    - Answers:
        - http://www.algorithm.cs.sunysb.edu/algowiki/index.php/The_Algorithms_Design_Manual_(Second_Edition)
        - http://blog.panictank.net/category/algorithmndesignmanualsolutions/page/2/
    - Errata:
        - http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/algorist/book/errata

    Once you've understood everything in the daily plan, and read and done exercises from the the books above,
    read and do exercises from the books below. Then move to coding challenges (further down below)

**Read first:**
- [ ] Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job, 2nd Edition:
    http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047012167X.html

**Read second (recommended by many, but not in Google coaching docs):**
- [ ] Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition:
    - http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/
    - If you see people reference "The Google Resume", it was a book replaced by "Cracking the Coding Interview".

#### Additional books (not suggested by Google but I added because I needed the background knowledge):

- [x] C Programming Language, Vol 2
    - answers to questions: https://github.com/lekkas/c-algorithms

- [x] C++ Primer Plus, 6th Edition

- [x] The Unix Programming Environment
    - http://product.half.ebay.com/The-UNIX-Programming-Environment-by-Brian-W-Kernighan-and-Rob-Pike-1983-Other/54385&tg=info

- [ ] Programming Pearls:
    - http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-Jon-Bentley/dp/0201657880

- [ ] Algorithms and Programming: Problems and Solutions:
    http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Programming-Solutions-Alexander-Shen/dp/0817638474

If you have time:

- [ ] Introduction to Algorithms
    - https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844
    - Half.com is a great resource for textbooks at good prices.
    
- [ ] Elements of Programming Interviews
    - https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Insiders-Guide/dp/1479274836
    - all code is in C++, if you're looking to use C++ in your interview
    - good book on problem solving in general.

## Coding exercises/challenges:

Once you've learned your brains out, put those brains to work.
Take coding challenges every day, as many as you can.

## Your Resume

- http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007_09_01_archive.html
- Great stuff at the back of Cracking The Coding Interview


## Be thinking of for when the interview comes:

- Think of about 20 interview questions you'll get, along the lines of the items below:
- have 2-3 answers for each
- Have a story, not just data, about something you accomplished

- Why do you want this job?
- What's a tough problem you've solved?
- Biggest challenges faced?
- Best/worst designs seen?
- Ideas for improving an existing Google product.
- How do you work best, as an individual and as part of a team?
- Which of your skills or experiences would be assets in the role and why?
- What did you most enjoy at [job x / project y]?
- What was the biggest challenge you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What was the hardest bug you faced at [job x / project y]?
- What did you learn at [job x / project y]?
- What would you have done better at [job x / project y]?

### Have questions for the interviewer.

Some of mine (I already may know answer to but want their opinion or team perspective):

- How large is your team?
- What is your dev cycle look like? Do you do waterfall/sprints/agile?
- Are rushes to deadlines common? Or is there flexibility?
- How are decisions made in your team?
- How many meetings do you have per week?
- Do you feel your work environment helps you concentrate?
- What are you working on?
- What do you like about it?
- What is the work life like?

## Additional Learning

    I added these to reinforce some ideas already presented above, but didn't want to include them
    above because it's just too much. It's easy to overdo it on a subject.
    You want to get hired in this century, right?
